# Rainfall Prediction in Australia

A group project for UBC MDS DSCI 525 - Web and Cloud Computing.

## Overview

This project involves working with big data. We will be building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

In Milestone 1, we will explore different methods to load, save and transform large datasets whilst also demonstrating the limits of our personal computers. The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rainfall-prediction-group14/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone_1.ipynb).

In Milestone 2, we transfer the data into the cloud and set up the infrastructure for machine learning. It involves setting up an EC2 instance in AWS, moving data in an S3 bucket, and data wrangling.
The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rainfall-prediction-group14/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone_2.ipynb).
