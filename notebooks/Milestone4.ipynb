Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "1. Setup an EC2 instance. Make sure you add a rule in security groups to accept `All TCP` connections from `Anywhere`. SSH into your EC2 instance from milestone2.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/app.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",

    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance. You want to configure your S3 for this. Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc.\n",

    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances `public IPv4 address` append with `:8080` into a browser, so something like `http://Public IPv4 address:8080`. From step 4, you might notice that flask output saying \"Running on http://XXXX:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\", where XXXX is `Private IPv4 address`, and you want to replace it with the `Public IPv4 address`\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    ">EG: curl -X POST http://your_EC2_ip:8080/predict -d '{\"data\":[1,2,3,4,53,11,22,37,41,53,11,24,31,44,53,11,22,35,42,53,12,23,31,42,53]}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n",

    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service?\n",
    "9. We could use several options to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try reaccessing your service with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "During milestone 1 we worked to combine and preprocess various csv files. We found that processing such large amounts of data varies between difference users' operating system and laptop capabilities. From this, we learnt about using various techniques to reduce the time taken to perform EDA such as changing data types, selecting fewer columns, and loading in chunks. Next we considered using a parquet file format which we ultimately used and converted our data into.\n",

    "2. **Week 2** <br>\n",
    "In milestone 2 we delved into the world of web and cloud computing by first moving our data into the cloud. To do this, we set up an EC2 via AWS and installed all the required packages. We set up an S3 bucket to store our data and outputs from the first milestone which connected to our EC2 instance. Our group ran into a few issues and spent a lot of time learning and trying to understand the concept of aws credentials and setting up users in the EC2 instance as none of us had encountered these concepts before. Once this was figured out, we processed the data in our EC2 instance and stored it back into our S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Week 3** <br>\n",
    "This week we learnt about EMR clusters and Spark which is better suited to working with big data than an EC2 instance. We learnt how to setup our jupyter environment and connect it to the EMR master node via SSH. Then we used the processed data from milestone 2 to develop a machine learning model (random forest regressor) and tuned its hyperparameters using Spark. Our final random forest model had parameters n_estimators = 100 and max_depth = 5. At the end of this process we produced a model.joblib file which housed our machine learning model of rainfalls that we will use in milestone 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Week 4** <br>\n",
    "In the final milestone of this course we developed our API to take in a POST request of 25 rainfall predictions, process it, and return a prediction for the rainfall. This prediction is returned in the form of a JSON file for the user to make use of however they wish. We then deployed this code in our EC2 instance using the Flask package and app.routes for use. Lastly, we tested our API using curl to send a POST request to ensure it was working properly. Once successful, we used screen to allow us to access our service even after we have exited our EC2 instance. Subsequently, we double checked that after closing the connection with our EC2 instance we were still able to access our predictor before finalising our write up of the four milestones and submitting our work.
